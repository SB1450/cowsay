# Cowsay

In this project I've dockerized the cowsay application and created an initialization script written in bash.

In order to start the app run the following script: ```bash init.sh```

The Cowsay app is listening by default on port 8080 if you want to run it on specific port you can guve it as argument after the init.sh script 

To see the app open this link: http://localhost:8080 or http://localhost:your_port
